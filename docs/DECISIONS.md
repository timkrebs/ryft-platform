# Decisions and discrepancies

Where the engagement prompt (`CLAUDE_PROMPT.md`) and the code disagreed, the prompt
won and the difference is recorded here. Judgement calls the prompt left open are
recorded too, so the iOS side and future changes can see why a number is what it is.

## D1 — Container runtime: Docker or Podman

The Makefile called `docker compose` / `docker build` unconditionally. The dev machine
this was built on has Podman only. `make` now uses `docker` when it is on `PATH`,
otherwise `podman` (`podman compose` runs the same `docker-compose.yml`). Override with
`make up CONTAINER=docker` or `COMPOSE="docker compose"`.

## D2 — Stale paths to the iOS app

`model.go` and the README pointed at `ios/Ryft/...` and `../app/RYFT/...`; the app
lives in `../app/Ryft/`. Comments and README fixed, no behaviour change.

## D3 — Readiness penalty shape and missing inputs

The prompt fixes the formula (`round(0.6·recovery + 0.4·sleep)`, "subtract up to 10
points when strain > 14 with recovery < 50") but not how the penalty scales. It ramps
linearly with yesterday's strain: 0 at 14, 10 at 21 (`ReadinessPenalty`), and is only
applied while today's recovery is below 50. "Recovery" is today's recovery — the only
one the prescribed signature `Readiness(recovery, sleepPerf, yesterdayStrain)` receives.

With no sleep recorded last night, readiness uses recovery for both terms (the same
renormalisation `Recovery` does for missing signals). With no recovery it is `null`.

## D4 — `state` is stored, and "calibrating" covers "no score"

`state` is computed at scoring time by `scoring.ReadinessState` and stored next to
`readiness` (migration 0002), so every reader gets the same value without importing
the thresholds. It is `calibrating` whenever the existing `calibrating` flag is set
(fewer than 7 nights of baseline) **or** readiness is `null` — the enum has no
separate "no data" value, and the app should show the calibrating copy in both cases.
