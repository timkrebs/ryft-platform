# Decisions and discrepancies

Where the engagement prompt (`CLAUDE_PROMPT.md`) and the code disagreed, the prompt
won and the difference is recorded here. Judgement calls the prompt left open are
recorded too, so the iOS side and future changes can see why a number is what it is.

## D1 — Container runtime: Docker or Podman

The Makefile called `docker compose` / `docker build` unconditionally. The dev machine
this was built on has Podman only. `make` now uses `docker` when it is on `PATH`,
otherwise `podman` (`podman compose` runs the same `docker-compose.yml`). Override with
`make up CONTAINER=docker` or `COMPOSE="docker compose"`.

## D2 — Stale paths to the iOS app

`model.go` and the README pointed at `ios/Ryft/...` and `../app/RYFT/...`; the app
lives in `../app/Ryft/`. Comments and README fixed, no behaviour change.
